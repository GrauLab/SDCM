%ABSTRACT
% Library function for SDCM. Signature focus, i.e. weights that are specific 
% and representative for the top genes/samples in a detected signature.
% Initial weights are based on the relative signal strengths. As soon as 
% correlations are availble, r*(1-p)ï¿½ are used as more specific base weights.
% For the signature focus, base weights >=50% are already mapped to full 
% membership (w=1). For signature size estimation and regression weights, 
% this is not optimal; herefore, the extended signature focus keeps the full
% dynamic range (only base weights of one yield w=1) in the default config.

We only need to focus roughly here anyway (these are only initial weights; the refined correlation-based weights are computed as defined below for every candidate, as soon as correlations have been computed in precomputeCandidatesInParallel).
